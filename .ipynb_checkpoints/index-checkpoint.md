Annabel, a young data analyst, has just joined a major American film studio preparing to release a range of new movies in 2025. After several disappointing box-office results in recent years, the CEO wants to maximize the chances of success by identifying ideal release periods along with what kind of movies are the most popular, and therefore profitable. By analyzing historical trends and patterns, Annabelâ€™s job is to advise on the best release timing for each upcoming movie while also pinpointing the key factors that make movies popular. Her findings ultimately reveal a deeper truth about how movies evolved over time.
