title: Annabel's story
subtitle: The way of the data analyst
---

Annabel, a young data analyst, has just joined a major American film studio preparing to release a range of new movies in 2025. After several disappointing box-office results in recent years, the CEO wants to maximize the chances of success by identifying ideal release periods along with what kind of movies are the most popular, and therefore profitable. By analyzing historical trends and patterns, Annabel’s job is to advise on the best release timing for each upcoming movie while also pinpointing the key factors that make movies popular. Her findings ultimately reveal a deeper truth about how movies evolved over time.


**What Drives Movie Success: Genres, Themes, or Release Timing?**
To guide her analysis effectively, Annabel considers which factors contribute most to a movie’s success. Taking the perspective of a producer focused solely on maximizing revenue, she chooses to evaluate success based on profitability, measured as the ratio of box office revenue to production budget. This approach reflects financial success regardless of audience appreciation, which isn’t always a reliable indicator in today’s market (as seen with recent Star Wars episodes).


Note: We assume that the dataset is representative of the movie industry in terms of genre distribution, meaning no specific genre is disproportionately underrepresented in any given year. However, the overall number of movies in the dataset may not be evenly distributed across time, as older movies (e.g., from 100 years ago) are less likely to be included compared to more recent releases. This does not imply that fewer movies were produced in the past.


After merging data from multiple sources, cleaning and handling it, Annabel is left with movie records spanning over 100 years. She wonders whether including such old data is meaningful and won't harm her analysis, given how much society has evolved over time. Factors like movie runtimes, peak release months, popular genres, and dominant themes may have changed significantly. For example, early films often had shorter runtimes due to technological limitations, while genres like superhero movies only gained popularity in recent decades.


However, first, she asks herself if there is anything to analyze to draw conclusions on.
